## üîÑ When to Update Archive

Archive documentation should be moved here when:

1. **Test results become outdated** - Quality scores, benchmarks from old runs
2. **Features change significantly** - Demos/examples no longer match current system
3. **Version supersedes** - New version makes old changelog historical
4. **Confusing to users** - Doc might mislead about current capabilities

**Last Updated:** October 3, 2025
**Current System Version:** v0.3.0
