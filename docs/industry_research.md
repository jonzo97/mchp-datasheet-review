### 2. Hybrid Rule-Based + LLM Systems

#### Architecture Pattern (Industry Standard)
```
Input Document
    ↓
Rule-Based Screening
    ├─ High Confidence (>0.95) → Auto-Approve ✅
    ├─ Low Confidence (<0.7) → High Priority for LLM 🚨
    └─ Medium Confidence → Normal LLM Queue 📋
         ↓
    LLM Review
         ↓
    Merge Suggestions
    ├─ Agreement → Confidence Boost
    ├─ LLM High Confidence → Trust LLM
    ├─ Both Uncertain → Human Queue 👤
    └─ Output Final Review
```

**Our Implementation**: `smart_queue.py` implements this exact pattern ✅

#### Key Benefits
- **Cost Optimization**: Only call expensive LLM API when needed
- **Speed**: Rule-based handles ~40% of cases instantly
- **Quality**: Hybrid agreement provides confidence boost
- **Transparency**: Rule-based provides explainable decisions

#### Real-World Applications
- **Legal Documents**: ClauseBuddy uses hybrid approach for contract review
- **Business Intelligence**: Research shows hybrid systems optimize for speed + adaptability
- **Customer Support**: Rule-based screening → LLM for nuanced cases

### 3. Vector Databases: ChromaDB vs SQLite

#### ChromaDB Advantages
- **Purpose-Built**: Designed specifically for vector embeddings and similarity search
- **Performance**: 2025 Rust rewrite delivers **4x performance boost** (eliminates Python GIL bottlenecks)
- **Scale**: Handles billion-scale embeddings efficiently
- **RAG Optimized**: Perfect for retrieval-augmented generation workflows
- **Use Cases**: Semantic search, document similarity, finding related sections

#### SQLite Advantages
- **Simplicity**: Single-file database, no additional service needed
- **Portability**: Works everywhere, easy to backup and inspect
- **Familiarity**: Standard SQL interface
- **Reliability**: Battle-tested for metadata and state management
- **Use Cases**: Structured data, processing state, review results

#### Our Recommendation: Hybrid Approach ✅
```
SQLite (Primary - Always Available)
├─ Document metadata & processing state
├─ Chunks, reviews, changes
├─ Cross-reference validation
└─ Processing queue & results

ChromaDB (Optional - Semantic Enhancement)
├─ Chunk embeddings for similarity search
├─ Historical pattern matching
├─ Document comparison (semantic diff)
└─ "Find similar issues" features
```

**Fallback Strategy**: If ChromaDB unavailable, all core functionality still works with SQLite alone.

### 4. Document Chunking Strategies (2025 Best Practices)

#### Evolution of Chunking
1. **Fixed-Size** (Basic) - Simple character/token limits with overlap
2. **Semantic** (Current Best Practice) - Preserve meaning and context boundaries
3. **Recursive** (Advanced) - Hierarchical chunking for structured documents
4. **Agentic** (Cutting Edge) - LLM dynamically determines chunk boundaries

#### Industry Recommendations (2025)
- **Recommended**: Recursive/semantic chunking with **10-20% overlap**
- **Align** chunk size with LLM context windows
- **Use** task-specific sentence transformers for embeddings
- **Optimize** for HNSW with metadata filtering for sub-100ms retrieval at 95%+ recall

#### Our Current Implementation
- ✅ Fixed-size chunking with overlap (solid baseline)
- 📋 **Planned**: Semantic-aware chunking (preserves section/paragraph boundaries)
- 🔮 **Future**: Agentic chunking with LLM-determined boundaries
